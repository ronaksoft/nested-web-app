        <p>
          Communications happen in PLACEs and users in each place are either:
          <b>Creator</b>, <b>Insider</b> or <b>Member</b>. Creators have the highest privileges in the place itself
          and all the child places. Users of child places are a subset of the parent place users.
          Places could be accessed by non-members. Although it is controlled by creators of the place.
          Depending on the place settings non-members can either have read, write or both access. Creators
          authority overrides in child places
        </p>
        <p>
          Messages composed by users are owned by the targeted places and senders have no control over
          their posted messages unless they get their authority from the place which owns the post.
        </p>
